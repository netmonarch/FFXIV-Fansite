# FFXIV-Fansite
Forum example with Final Fantasy XIV in mind.

Click on the links and explore this file. It is meant to act as example of my ability to CRUD - Create, Read, Upload, Delete.

Register with whatever information you like and login. The rest should explain itself. Don't worry about spamming either. I always reupload a previous version of this project so it returns to defaults.


Changes:
Added a username and password that a user can freely use for browsing purposes.
