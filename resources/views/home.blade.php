		This is an example project dedicated to my favorite game of the current generation: Final Fantasy XIV Online.
		It is currently on its 3rd expansion, Shadowbringers. More than a just a game, Final Fantasy XIV is an extension
		of who I am as a person. My character, Shane Farlander, is forthright, intellectually superior in several ways, but
		a little quirky in his wisdom.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
		Shane has surpassed a great many trials to get where he is, and still has yet more to conquer. He only asks that
		adventurers of equal or great measure join him in his endeavors, as he is almost never alone! With a codex of 
		ancient knowledge at his hip, and the trustworthy fae aspect Eos at his shoulder, there is almost no obstacle
		that he cannot ascend.
